/// backend-agnostic detection logic — [`SpeechSegmenter`], the
/// [`detect_speech_with`] one-shot helper — drives a backend through
/// this trait and never touches the underlying model, so the same
/// segmentation semantics work over the bundled ONNX backend
/// (`Session`, behind the default `onnx` feature) or any other
/// implementation (e.g. a CoreML backend declaring a different frame
/// geometry).

/// [`frame_samples`](VadBackend::frame_samples) declares how many
/// samples make up one frame; the detector advances its timeline by
/// exactly that many samples per probability and chunks incoming PCM
/// accordingly. It is decoupled from
/// [`SampleRate::chunk_samples`] on purpose: the ONNX backend declares
/// `512` at 16 kHz (identical to `chunk_samples`), while a backend built
/// around a different artifact can declare any positive frame size (for
/// example `4096`) and reuse the same detector unchanged.
